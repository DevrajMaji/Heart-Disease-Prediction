## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can save lives.  
In this project, a **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on a dataset containing key medical features such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type (cp)  
- Blood Pressure (trestbps)  
- Cholesterol (chol)  
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)  
- Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)  
- Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)  
- ST Depression (oldpeak)  
- Slope, ca, thal
